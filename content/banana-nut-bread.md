## Ingredients
- 2 or 3 overly ripe bananas
- 1 1/2 cups AP or whole wheat flour, whatever you have.
- 3/4 cup of sugar
- 1/3 cup melted butter
- 1/4 cup of chopped walnuts, or however much you have on hand.
- 1 egg
- 1 tsp vanilla
- 1/2 tsp baking soda
- Pinch of Salt

## Directions
- Preheat oven to 350 degrees. 
- Spray the bottom of your loaf pan.
- In a bowl, mash the bananas and then stir in the melted butter.
- Stir in all of the remaining ingredients. 
- Pour batter into the loaf pan.
- Bake for 55 minutes or so. Toothpick must come out clean from the center.

## Notes
- Use overly ripe bananas, most groceries stores sell these in a bag near the regular bananas, and they are dirt cheap!
